           The Graduate School of Norton University was started in February 2001 in affiliation with Ateneo de Zamboanga University in the Philippines with its initial offering of the Master in Business Administration (MBA) program with 36 students enrolled in the first batch. Hence, the diplomas for the first two MBA classes were signed by the Rector and the President, respectively, of Norton University and Ateneo de Zamboanga University.
