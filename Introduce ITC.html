        <h5 class="mt-5" aligni="center">
            In the current context of globalization and fast transformations of new technologies ITC’s main concerns are to play an efficient role in the Cambodian society and to be at the cutting edge of development to improve our educational system.
            Our goal is to provide students with a high quality education in the fields of engineering sciences and technologies. Students are provided with technical know-how and skills of analysis which allow integration and evolution in the labor market. To achieve this, the academic and international scientific research requires development.
            Besides our academic activities, ITC contributes to maintain sustainable development and decrease the inequalities within our society through its internal functioning and opening-up to foreign countries and the way their students get admitted.
            The current development of ITC owes a lot to the support of the national community and the great efforts made by staffs and students from generation to generation.  
            In 1993, Cambodian and French governments agreed to renovate ITC with a view to improve performance of the administration and financial services along with the educational system of the institution and the human resources.

            <p> 
                The Institute was founded in 1964 as Institut Technique Supérieur de l'Amitié Khméro–Soviétique (ITSAKS; The Superior Technical Institute of Khmer–Soviet Friendship, Khmer: វិទ្យាស្ថានបច្ចេកទេសជាន់ខ្ពស់មិត្តភាពខ្មែរ-សូវៀត). It was funded by the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1975 and from 1980 to 1991. This support ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.[not verified in body]
                In 1993, the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Government of France signed an agreement to develop the renovation of the institute which then took its present name, Institut de Technologie du Cambodge. From 1993 to 2004 the ITC was operated under the framework of French grant assistance (the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French embassy) and was run by Cambodia's French-language Agency of Higher Education (AUF).
